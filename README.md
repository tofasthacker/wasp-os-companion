# wasp-os companion

A companion app for [wasp-os](https://github.com/daniel-thompson/wasp-os/) smartwatches.

This app is still in early development, so there may be bugs.

As I use a Windows computer, I cannot create the iOS portion of this app. If you have an Apple device and would like to contribute, then that would be awesome.

## Getting Started

wasp-os companion is built on Flutter, with native Android code for background services.
To install the app, check [Github Actions](https://github.com/tofasthacker/wasp-os-companion/actions) for the latest version.
